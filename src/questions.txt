1. Are you familiar with pycharm? If so, do you know why I can't enter certain commit messages?
     Example: git commit -m 'adds solutions'
        error: pathspec 'adds' did not match any file(s) known to git
        error: pathspec 'solutions'' did not match any file(s) known to git

2. 12_scopes.py
        Q: Did I answer task #2 correctly?
        Q: Why do I need to global keywords?

3. shadows name from outer scope? Not sure how to correct this warning for PEP8.

4. Class inheritance
    Parent class has a method called information.
        This methods prints name and birth year.

    How do I inherit this method to a child class and change it up to print name birth year and college?
    Or would it make more sense to just create a new method in the child class to do exactly what I want?
